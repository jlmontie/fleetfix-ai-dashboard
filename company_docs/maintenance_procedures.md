## 3. Emergency Procedures

### Vehicle Breakdown Protocol

**Step 1: Driver Safety**
1. Move vehicle to safe location if possible
2. Turn on hazard lights
3. Set up emergency triangles if available
4. Driver exits vehicle safely

**Step 2: Initial Assessment**
Driver should report:
- Warning lights active
- Unusual sounds, smells, or smoke
- Last known vehicle behavior
- Current location and traffic conditions

**Step 3: Dispatch Decision Tree**

**IF smoke or fire:**
- Emergency services immediately
- Abandon vehicle
- Full tow required

**IF fluid leak (significant):**
- Do not restart engine
- Flatbed tow required
- Take photo of leak

**IF warning light only (no smoke, no unusual sounds):**
- Approved to restart once
- If starts normally: drive to nearest service center
- If problem persists: tow required

**Step 4: Towing**
- Use approved tow providers (see section 5)
- Tow to nearest FleetFix service center
- If after hours: tow to provider lot, service next business day

### Tire Blowout Procedure

**Driver Instructions:**
1. Maintain firm grip on steering wheel
2. DO NOT slam brakes
3. Gradually reduce speed
4. Move to shoulder safely
5. Turn on hazards

**Assessment:**
- If spare tire available: Driver may change if trained and safe to do so
- If no spare or unsafe location: Call roadside assistance
- Fleet spares available at KC distribution center

**Tire Replacement Standards:**
- Minimum tread depth: 4/32"
- No repairs on sidewall damage
- Maximum 1 plug repair per tire
- Replace in pairs if tread depth difference >3/32"

## 4. Maintenance Cost Guidelines

### Monthly Budget Per Vehicle

**Light Duty (Sedans, Small Vans):**
- Average: $85/month
- Preventive: $60/month
- Repairs: $25/month
- Annual total: ~$1,020

**Medium Duty (Cargo Vans, Small Trucks):**
- Average: $145/month
- Preventive: $95/month
- Repairs: $50/month
- Annual total: ~$1,740

**Heavy Duty (Large Trucks, Box Trucks):**
- Average: $220/month
- Preventive: $140/month
- Repairs: $80/month
- Annual total: ~$2,640

**Cost Escalation Factors:**
- Age: +15% per year after year 5
- Mileage: +10% for vehicles over 100K miles
- Driver behavior: High harsh braking events add 8-12% to brake costs
- Climate: Salt belt states add 12-18% for rust-related repairs

---

### When to Repair vs. Replace

**Repair if:**
- Vehicle under 8 years old AND under 150K miles
- Repair cost less than 60% of vehicle value
- No history of repeat major failures
- Expected remaining service life >2 years

**Replace if:**
- Repair cost exceeds 60% of current vehicle value
- Vehicle over 10 years or 200K miles
- Multiple major systems failing
- Safety concerns
- Total annual maintenance exceeds $3,500

**Example Calculation:**
- Vehicle value: $8,000
- Repair quote: $5,200 (transmission)
- Age: 9 years, 185K miles
- Decision: **REPLACE** - repair is 65% of value, vehicle is near end of life
