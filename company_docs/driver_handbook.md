| Rapid Acceleration | -3 points | Acceleration >7 mph/sec |
| Hard Cornering | -4 points | Lateral G-force >0.6g |
| Speeding (1-9 mph over) | -2 points | Per instance |
| Speeding (10+ mph over) | -10 points | Per instance |
| Excessive Idle Time | -1 point | Per 10 min over 30 min/day |
| Seatbelt Violation | -15 points | Per trip without seatbelt |

**Starting Score:** Each day begins at 100 points  
**Minimum Score:** 0 (cannot go negative)
