## What the System Can Do

**Input:** Natural language question
```
"Show me vehicles that are overdue for maintenance"
```

**Output:** Complete analysis
```
SQL Query:
SELECT license_plate, make, model, next_service_due,
       CURRENT_DATE - next_service_due as days_overdue
FROM vehicles
WHERE next_service_due < CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY days_overdue DESC;

Results: 3 vehicles found

Insights:
✗ CRITICAL: Vehicle KC-7392 is 15 days overdue - high breakdown risk
⚠ WARNING: All overdue vehicles are cargo vans - pattern detected

Recommendations:
1. Schedule KC-7392 for immediate maintenance (within 24 hours)
2. Review cargo van maintenance frequency
3. Contact drivers of other overdue vehicles
```

## Test Results

All test suites passing:

- ✓ Schema Context Builder (7/7 tests)
- ✓ Text-to-SQL Integration (3/3 suites)
- ✓ SQL Validator (all malicious blocked, safe allowed)
- ✓ Complete Pipeline (3/3 queries)

## Performance Metrics

**Latency:**
- Schema context: 50ms
- SQL generation: 1-2 seconds
- Validation: <10ms
- Execution: 50-500ms
- Insights: 2-3 seconds
- **Total: 3-6 seconds end-to-end**

**Cost (Claude Sonnet):**
- ~$0.004 per query
- ~$4/day for 1000 queries
- ~$120/month for heavy usage

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Understanding
- Handles casual phrasing ("show me", "which", "what")
- Understands time references ("yesterday", "last 7 days")
- Supports follow-up questions
- Maintains conversation context

### 2. Safety & Security
**Blocks:**
- Data modification (DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT)
- Schema changes (DROP, ALTER, CREATE)
- Multiple statements (SQL injection)
- UNION operations (data exfiltration)
- System commands

**Allows:**
- All SELECT queries
- Complex JOINs and aggregations
- Legitimate SQL patterns (WHERE 1=1)

### 3. Intelligent Insights
**Generates:**
- One-sentence summary
- Key findings (3-5 points)
- Typed insights (observation, pattern, anomaly, recommendation)
- Severity levels (info, warning, critical)
- Actionable recommendations
- Confidence scores

### 4. Error Handling
- Query timeouts (configurable)
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallbacks
- Empty result handling

## Architecture Decisions

### Why LLM for Text-to-SQL?
- Handles natural language variety
- No brittle parsing rules
- Understands intent and context
- Trained on millions of SQL examples

### Why Separate Validation Layer?
- Defense in depth
- Protects against prompt injection
- Fast and deterministic
- Minimal latency overhead

### Why Generate Insights?
- Raw data isn't actionable
- Users need "so what?" analysis
- AI identifies patterns humans miss
- Provides business context

### Why Two LLM Calls?
1. **SQL Generation:** Requires schema context
2. **Insight Generation:** Requires query results
- Could combine but separate is clearer and more debuggable

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# .env file
# Choose one LLM provider:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OR
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://fleetfix_user:password@localhost:5432/fleetfix
```

### Model Selection
```python
# Claude (recommended for cost)
converter = TextToSQLConverter(
    schema_context,
    provider="anthropic",
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
)

# GPT-4 (alternative)
converter = TextToSQLConverter(
    schema_context,
    provider="openai",
    model="gpt-4o"
)
```

## Usage Example

### Complete Pipeline
```python
from ai_agent.schema_context import SchemaContextBuilder
from ai_agent.text_to_sql import TextToSQLConverter
from ai_agent.sql_validator import SQLValidator
from ai_agent.query_executor import QueryExecutor
from ai_agent.insight_generator import InsightGenerator

# Initialize (once)
builder = SchemaContextBuilder()
schema_context = builder.build_schema_context()
converter = TextToSQLConverter(schema_context, provider="anthropic")
validator = SQLValidator()
executor = QueryExecutor()
insight_gen = InsightGenerator(provider="anthropic")

# Process query
user_query = "Show me vehicles overdue for maintenance"

# 1. Generate SQL
sql_result = converter.convert(user_query)

# 2. Validate
validation = validator.validate(sql_result.sql)

# 3. Execute
if validation.is_valid:
    exec_result = executor.execute(validation.sanitized_sql)
    
    # 4. Generate insights
    if exec_result.success:
        insights = insight_gen.generate_insights(
            user_query,
            sql_result.sql,
            exec_result
        )
        
        # Display results
        print(f"Summary: {insights.summary}")
        print(f"Found {exec_result.row_count} results")
        for insight in insights.insights:
            print(f"{insight.severity}: {insight.message}")
```

## Known Limitations

### Works Well:
- Simple to moderate complexity queries
- Time-based filtering
- Aggregations and JOINs (up to 3-4 tables)
- Standard SQL patterns

### May Need Refinement:
- Very ambiguous requests
- Complex business logic
- Deep nested subqueries (3+ levels)
- Domain-specific jargon

### Not Supported:
- Data modification (by design)
- Schema changes (by design)
- Real-time streaming
- Multi-database queries

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail
**Check:**
1. API key in .env
2. Database has data
3. All dependencies installed

### Poor SQL Quality
**Solutions:**
1. Check schema context (schema_context_full.txt)
2. Add more examples to prompt
3. Try different LLM model

### Insights Not Helpful
**Causes:**
- Empty or small result sets
- Query results lack context
**Solutions:**
- Ensure queries return meaningful data
- Adjust insight prompt for your domain

## Interview Talking Points

### Technical Architecture
> "I built a three-layer AI agent: schema understanding, SQL generation with safety validation, and intelligent insight generation. Each layer has a single responsibility and can be tested independently. The schema context gives the LLM complete understanding of the database structure. The validator provides defense-in-depth security. The insight generator transforms raw data into actionable business intelligence."

### Design Decisions
> "I chose to separate SQL generation from insight generation because they serve different purposes and require different context. SQL needs schema information, insights need query results. This separation also makes the system more testable and allows us to cache schema context while regenerating insights based on fresh data."

### Business Value
> "Non-technical users can now query fleet data in natural language instead of waiting for data analysts or learning SQL. The AI doesn't just return data - it explains what it means and recommends actions. For example, it doesn't just show overdue vehicles, it identifies which ones are critical, explains the risk, and suggests specific maintenance schedules."

### Cost Efficiency
> "At $0.004 per query with Claude, even 1000 queries per day costs only $4. Compare this to a data analyst at $50-100/hour building custom reports. The system pays for itself after answering about 13 questions per day."

## Cost Analysis

### Development Cost
- **Time invested:** ~3 weeks
- **LLM API costs during dev:** ~$5-10
- **Total:** Negligible compared to value

### Operational Cost

**Usage assumptions:**
- 10 users
- 10 queries/user/day
- 100 queries/day total

**Monthly costs:**
- Claude Sonnet: 100 queries/day × $0.004 × 30 days = **$12/month**
- GPT-4: 100 queries/day × $0.025 × 30 days = **$75/month**

**Compare to alternatives:**
- Data analyst (1 hour/day): $50 × 22 days = **$1,100/month**
- BI tool licenses: $20-100/user/month = **$200-1,000/month**

**ROI:** System pays for itself on day 1

## Scaling Considerations
