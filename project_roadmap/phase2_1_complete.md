# Phase 2.1: Schema Context Builder - Complete

## What You Built

A sophisticated database introspection system that:
- Reads PostgreSQL schema automatically
- Adds business context to technical definitions
- Generates LLM-friendly descriptions
- Provides both detailed and concise versions
- Detects relationships and constraints

## Files to Create

```
backend/
└── ai_agent/
    ├── __init__.py                # Empty file (makes it a package)
    ├── schema_context.py          # Core builder (artifact provided)
    └── test_schema_context.py     # Test suite (artifact provided)
```

## Setup Steps

1. **Create directory:**
```bash
cd backend
mkdir -p ai_agent
touch ai_agent/__init__.py
```

2. **Copy files** from artifacts to:
   - `backend/ai_agent/schema_context.py`
   - `backend/ai_agent/test_schema_context.py`

3. **Run tests:**
```bash
python ai_agent/test_schema_context.py
```

4. **Review output:**
   - Check `schema_context_full.txt`
   - Check `schema_context_concise.txt`

✓ Primary key detected: ['id']

Test 3: Relationship Detection
✓ vehicle_id -> vehicles.id detected
✓ driver_id -> drivers.id detected

Test 4: Full Context Generation
✓ All required sections present
  Total context length: ~8,000 characters
  Approximate tokens: ~2,000

Test 5: Concise Context Generation
✓ Concise context generated
  Full context: 8,000 chars
  Concise context: 2,000 chars
  Reduction: 75%

Test 6: Sample Data Retrieval
✓ drivers: Sample retrieved successfully
✓ vehicles: Sample retrieved successfully
✓ fault_codes: Sample retrieved successfully

Test 7: Token Estimation
  Full context: ~2,000 tokens
  Concise context: ~500 tokens

✓ Full context saved to: schema_context_full.txt
✓ Concise context saved to: schema_context_concise.txt

Total: 7/7 tests passed

✓ All tests passed! Schema context builder is ready.
```

## What the LLM Will See

Example from `schema_context_full.txt`:

```
# FleetFix Database Schema

This is a PostgreSQL database for a fleet management system called FleetFix.

## Tables Overview

- **vehicles** (30 rows): Fleet vehicles including make, model, mileage, 
  and maintenance schedule

## Detailed Schema

### vehicles
Fleet vehicles including make, model, mileage, and maintenance schedule

**Columns:**
- `id` (INTEGER) [PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL]
- `vin` (VARCHAR(17)) [NOT NULL]
  Vehicle identification number (unique)
- `next_service_due` (DATE)
  Date when next maintenance is scheduled
- `status` (VARCHAR(20)) [NOT NULL]
  Vehicle status: active, maintenance, inactive, or retired

## Key Relationships

- vehicles → maintenance_records (one-to-many)
- vehicles → telemetry (one-to-many)

## Important Notes

- Use CURRENT_DATE for queries about 'today' or 'yesterday'
- Vehicle status values: 'active', 'maintenance', 'inactive', 'retired'

## Example Query Patterns

```sql
-- Vehicles overdue for maintenance
SELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE next_service_due < CURRENT_DATE;
```
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Schema Discovery**
   - Reads PostgreSQL information schema
   - Detects all tables, columns, types
   - Finds primary and foreign keys

2. **Business Context Enrichment**
   - Adds human-readable descriptions
   - Explains what each column means
   - Provides value examples

3. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Detects foreign key relationships
   - Shows table connections
   - Explains one-to-many relationships

4. **Query Pattern Examples**
   - Provides SQL templates
   - Shows proper syntax
   - Demonstrates CURRENT_DATE usage

5. **Token Optimization**
   - Full version: comprehensive (~2000 tokens)
   - Concise version: minimal (~500 tokens)
   - Flexible based on needs

## Why This Matters for Phase 2.2

When building text-to-SQL, the LLM needs to know:

**Without schema context:**
```
User: "Show me broken vehicles"
LLM: SELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE broken = true
Result: Error - no 'broken' column exists
```

**With schema context:**
```
User: "Show me broken vehicles"
LLM sees: vehicles.status can be 'active', 'maintenance', 'inactive', 'retired'
LLM: SELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE status = 'maintenance'
Result: ✓ Correct SQL!
```

## Design Decisions Explained

### Why Include Row Counts?

Helps LLM understand data volume:
- `telemetry (130,000 rows)` → LLM knows to be careful with queries
- `drivers (25 rows)` → LLM knows this is small, can join freely

### Why Two Context Versions?

- **Full:** Best accuracy, comprehensive
- **Concise:** Token-efficient, faster
- **Choice:** Start with full (tokens are cheap)

### Why Include Example Queries?

LLM learns patterns:
- Sees `CURRENT_DATE` usage → uses it correctly
- Sees JOIN patterns → applies them properly
- Sees WHERE clauses → generates similar logic

## Common Issues

### All tests pass but context looks wrong?

Check business descriptions in `schema_context.py`:
```python
TABLE_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    'vehicles': 'Your description here'
}
```

### Foreign keys not detected?

Verify schema.sql was run:
```bash
psql -U fleetfix_user -d fleetfix -f database/schema.sql
```

### Import errors?

Check directory structure:
```bash
backend/
├── ai_agent/
│   ├── __init__.py      # Must exist!
│   └── schema_context.py
└── database/
    └── [existing files]
```

## Next: Phase 2.2 - Text-to-SQL

Now that LLM can understand your schema, we'll build:

1. **LLM Integration**
   - OpenAI or Anthropic API
   - Prompt templates
   - Response parsing

2. **SQL Generation**
   - Natural language → SQL
   - Context injection
   - Error handling

3. **Safety Layer**
   - Query validation
   - Dangerous operation detection
   - SQL injection prevention

**Estimated time:** 1 week

**Files to create:**
- `ai_agent/text_to_sql.py` - LLM integration
- `ai_agent/sql_validator.py` - Safety checks
- `ai_agent/test_text_to_sql.py` - Tests

## Status Check

Before proceeding:

- [ ] Tests pass (7/7)
- [ ] Context files generated
- [ ] Context includes business descriptions
- [ ] Foreign keys detected
- [ ] Row counts accurate

**If all checked:** Ready for Phase 2.2!

**If not:** Review troubleshooting section above.
